# Drag sensitive select operator for blender Sequencer
In Blender 2.80 you can select multiple 3D-objects and move them together by
clicking and dragging if the move tool is selected. Clicking and dragging nodes
in the node editor works the same. In the sequencer, you still need to press G
to move multiple strips because clicking and dragging will only move the strip
you clicked on.

This add-on changes that. Everything works as usual but if you click and drag
on a selected strip or handle, all selected strips and handles will be moved
together.

## Installation
1. Download the [vse_drag_sensitive_select.py](https://github.com/Salatfreak/VSEDragSensitiveSelect/raw/master/vse_drag_sensitive_select.py) script
2. Open Blender 2.8
3. Open the Add-on preferences (Edit -> Preferences... -> Add-ons)
4. Click "Install..." and select the script file
5. Enable the add-on by clicking on the checkbox next to it
